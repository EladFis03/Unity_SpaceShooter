# Unity_SpaceShooter

## â€‹The Theme
When the Zylbrad armada invades your home plant - Veldin, it is up to you to protect what you can and destroy as many enemy ships as you can. You will be guided by Admiral Aliencber, Dr. Fright, and your old mentor: Brain.

With their help and your skill, the Zylbrad army will wish they never came to Veldin... Right?

## Gameplay
This is a game like Star Fox and others in that genre. By using the Up/W, Down/S, Left/A, and Right/D keys you'll maneuver to the terrain.
To fire, use the Spacebar/Left mouse key - you will earn points for every hit and ship destroyed.
Good luck pilot.
