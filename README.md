# Unity_SpaceShooter

## The Theme
When the Zylbrad armada invades your home plant - Veldin, it is up to you to protect what you can and destroy as many enemy ships as you can.
You will be guided be Admirel Aliencber, Dr. Fright and your old mentor: Brain.

With their help, and your skill, the Zylbrad army will wish they never came to Veldin... Right?


## Gameplay
This is a game similer to Star Fox and others in that genre.
By using the Up/W, Down/S, Left/A, Right/D keys you'll maneuver to terrain. 
To fire, use the Spacebar/Left mouse key - you will earn points for every hit, and for every ship destroyed.

Good luck pilot.
